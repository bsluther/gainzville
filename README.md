This is a 2022 prototype of Gainzville, built as a standard client-server web app. I was focused on building a model and UX which was flexible enough to allow users to create their owns activities (run, rock climb, Romanian deadlift) and data types. It started as a desktop-only web app and I eventually started working on a mobile-friendly version to support what I still see as a primary use case: entering workout data on a phone while at the gym or out climbing. My experience trying to create a good user experience for a highly interactive app with many data fields in a mobile web browser eventually led me to React Native and, a few years later, Swift.
